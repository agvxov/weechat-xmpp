 content and server-side event connections.

 To keep it simple, it serves the static stuff from the subdirectory
 "./mount-origin" of the directory it was started in.

 VERSION HISTORY:
 Bob Trower 08/04/01 -- Create Version 0.00.00B
 .
 I cleaned it up quite a bit to match the (linux kernel) style of the rest
 of libwebsockets; this version is under LGPL2.1 + SLE like the rest of lws
 since he explicitly allows sublicensing, but I give the URL above so you can
 get the original with Bob's super-liberal terms directly if you prefer.

 Acme is in a big messy transition at the moment from a homebrewed api
 to an IETF one.  The old repo for the homebrew api (they currently
 implement) is marked up as deprecated and "not accurate[ly] reflect[ing]"
 what they implement, but the IETF standard, currently at v7 is not yet
 implemented at let's encrypt (ETA Jan 2018).
 .
 This implementation follows draft 7 of the IETF standard, and falls back
 to whatever differences exist for Boulder's tls-sni-01 challenge.  The
 tls-sni-02 support is there but nothing to test it against at the time of
 writing (Nov 1 2017).

 This is intended to be mounted somewhere in your ESP32 user app... if the
 client touched the mount, the plugin hangs up and reboots into the
 factory mode one second later.
 .
 The factory mode will reassociate with the same IP with the same MAC
 shortly afterwards and be accessible by the same IP / mDNS name.

 uses a libuv event loop created outside lws.  It shows how lws can
 participate in someone else's event loop and clean up after itself.

 You choose the event loop to work with at runtime, by giving the
 --uv, --event or --ev switch.  Lws has to have been configured to build the
 selected event lib support.

 Thanks to Rodney Brown <rbrown64@csc.com.au> for his contribution of faster
 CRC methods: exclusive-oring 32 bits of data at a time, and pre-computing
 tables for updating the shift register in one step with three exclusive-ors
 instead of four steps with four exclusive-ors.  This results in about a
 factor of two increase in speed on a Power PC G4 (PPC7455) using gcc -O3.

 For these reasons and the response I got trying to raise these issues with
 them, if you have a choice about event loop, I would gently encourage you
 to avoid libev.  Where lws uses an event loop itself, eg in lwsws, we use
 libuv.

 Structure for decoding tables.  Each entry provides either the
 information needed to do the operation requested by the code that
 indexed that table entry, or it provides a pointer to another
 table that indexes more bits of the code.  op indicates whether
 the entry is a pointer to another table, a literal, a length or
 distance, an end-of-block, or an invalid code.  For a table
 pointer, the low four bits of op is the number of index bits of
 that table.  For a length or distance, the low four bits of op
 is the number of extra bits to get after the code.  bits is
 the number of bits in this code or part of the code to drop off
 of the bit buffer.  val is the actual byte to output in the case
 of a literal, the base length or distance, or the offset from
 the current table to the next table.  Each entry is four bytes.

 This demonstrates a ws client that sends bulk data in multiple
 ws fragments, in a way compatible with per-message deflate.
 .
 It shows how to send huge messages without needing a lot of memory.
 .
 Build and start the minimal-examples/ws-server/minmal-ws-server-pmd-bulk
 example first.  Running this sends a large message to the server and
 exits.
 .
 If you give both sides the -n commandline option, it disables permessage-
 deflate compression extension.

 Two threads are spawned that produce messages to be sent to the broker,
 via a local ringbuffer.  Locking is provided to make ringbuffer access
 threadsafe.

 When a nailed-up client connection to the broker is established, the
 ringbuffer is sent to the broker, which distributes the events to all
 connected clients.

 files in the 'jni' directory:
 .
 zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz
 openssl-1.0.2g.tar.gz
 libwebsockets.tar.gz

 This makefile was tested with the latest NDK/SDK and Android Studio at the
 time of this writing. As these software packages evolve changes to this
 makefile may be needed or it may become obselete...

 At least on Debian, building openssl requires package xutils-dev
 for makedepend. Ofcourse the standard development packages must also be
 installed, but xutils-dev is not that obvious in this case...

 stage of building openssl. In this case these warnings can be safely ignored.

 By default the connections happen all together at the beginning and operate
 concurrently, which is fast.  However this is resource-intenstive, there are
 8 tcp connections, 8 tls tunnels on both the client and server.  You can
 instead opt to have the connections happen one after the other inside a
 single tcp connection and tls tunnel, using HTTP/1.1 pipelining.  To be

 connections as being in publisher or subscriber mode according to the URL the ws
 connection was made to.  ws connections to "/publisher" URL are understood to be

 ALGORITHM
 .
 The "deflation" process depends on being able to identify portions
 of the input text which are identical to earlier input (within a
 sliding window trailing behind the input currently being processed).
 .
 The most straightforward technique turns out to be the fastest for
 most input files: try all possible matches and select the longest.
 The key feature of this algorithm is that insertions into the string
 dictionary are very simple and thus fast, and deletions are avoided
 completely. Insertions are performed at each input character, whereas
 string matches are performed only when the previous match ends. So it
 is preferable to spend more time in matches to allow very fast string
 insertions and avoid deletions. The matching algorithm for small
 strings is inspired from that of Rabin & Karp. A brute force approach
 is used to find longer strings when a small match has been found.
 A similar algorithm is used in comic (by Jan-Mark Wams) and freeze
 (by Leonid Broukhis).
 A previous version of this file used a more sophisticated algorithm
 (by Fiala and Greene) which is guaranteed to run in linear amortized
 time, but has a larger average cost, uses more memory and is patented.
 However the F&G algorithm may be faster for some highly redundant

 This demonstrates the most minimal http server you can make with lws,
 with an added websocket proxy distributing what is received on a
 dumb-increment wss connection to https://libwebsockets.org to all
 browsers connected to this server.
 .
 To keep it simple, it serves stuff in the subdirectory "./mount-origin" of
 the directory it was started in.
 You can change that by changing mount.origin.

 this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
 distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
 Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
 Contributor:
 .
 (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
     or
 .
 (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
     Version); or
 .
 (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
     its Contributions.
 .
 This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
 or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with

 to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
 .
 2.6. Fair Use

 applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
 equivalents.
 .
 2.7. Conditions
 .
 Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
 in Section 2.1.
 .
 3. Responsibilities
 -------------------
 .
 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
 .
 All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
 Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
 the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
 Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
 License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
 attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
 Form.
 .
 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
 .
 If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
 .
 (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
 .
 (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
 .
 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
 .
 You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
 provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
 the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
 Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
 Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
 License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
 under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
 the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
 Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
 License(s).
 .
 3.4. Notices
 .
 You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
 (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
 or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
 the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
 the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
 .
 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
 .
 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
 Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
 behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
 such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
 You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
 liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
 disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
 jurisdiction.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
 be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
 Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
 or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
 recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
 .
 5. Termination
 --------------
 .
 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
 if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
 compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
 Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
 ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
 non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
 come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
 first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
 from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
 Your receipt of the notice.
 .
 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
 infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
 counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
 directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
 You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
 .
 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
 end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
 have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
 prior to termination shall survive termination.

 *  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
 *  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
 *  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
 *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
 *  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
 *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
 *  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
 *  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
 *  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
 *  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
 *  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
